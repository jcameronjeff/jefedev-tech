            <p>Jeff Cameron: moved to Savannah from Florida via a two year stint in Southern California. Passionate about the water, he’s never lived off the coast. He received a Communication Studies degree from Stetson University, and began his professional life at Brainchild Corporation, developing e-learning content solutions for higher student achievements.
            Following his passion to get outdoors and on the water, he transitioned in to a sales career that took him out West to the surfing capital of the world. </p>

            <p>Returning East, he utilized his sales skillset in the non-profit sector as a job coach for individuals with disabilities. Now, Jeff is returning to his tech roots by attending Georgia Tech’s Web Developer Bootcamp. He sees endless opportunity in tech to create. At his core, Jeff is a creative individual with a mind for problem solving.
